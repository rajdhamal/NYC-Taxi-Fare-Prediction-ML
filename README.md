Developed Machine Learning models using different ML techniques : Linear Regression, SVM, KNN, NN and Random Forest.
Compared the RMSE values of all the models in order to find out which model is best fit to predict the taxi fares. Random Forest yielded the least RMSE value.
Developed a GUI that actually predicted the taxi fare in NYC on the basis of different input parameters(Longitude, Latitude, Date, Day, Hour etc)
